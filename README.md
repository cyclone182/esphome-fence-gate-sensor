# esphome-fence-gate-sensor
This project uses an ESP board to create a fence gate sensor utilizing ESPHome. The configuration will report status on gate open or closed, as well as wifi connectivity status. The three LED's on the board (and their corresponding code in the config file) are completely optional but are useful for troubleshooting the physical installation.

<p>The following was done on an ESP8266 board, however it should work with a ESP32 with some tweaking.</p>
<p>For this project you will need the ESP board, small prototype board, jumper wire, usb power supply, waterproof magnetic reed switch, three different colored LED's, and three appropriate resistors for the LED's you selected.</p>
<p>Instructions:</p>
<p>1. Upload the config file code from this resposity to your ESP device.</p>
<p>2. WORK IN PROGRESS...........</p>
